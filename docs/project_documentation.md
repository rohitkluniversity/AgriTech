# AgriTech Platform - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

AgriTech is built using Django's MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture, which is equivalent to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

### Components

- **Models**: Define the database structure and business logic
- **Templates**: Handle the presentation layer
- **Views**: Process user requests and return responses
- **URLs**: Map URLs to view functions
- **Forms**: Handle user input validation
- **Admin**: Provide administrative interface for content management

## Database Schema

### Core Models

1. **UserProfile**
   - Extends Django's User model
   - Stores user type (buyer/seller), contact information, and preferences

2. **BaseContent**
   - Abstract base class for content models
   - Includes common fields like title, content, language, created/updated timestamps

3. **GovernmentScheme**
   - Stores information about agricultural subsidy programs
   - Includes eligibility criteria, benefits, application process

4. **FarmingPractice**
   - Documents different farming techniques
   - Categorizes by practice type (organic, fish, mountain, livestock, etc.)

5. **AgriculturalTechnology**
   - Catalogs modern farming technologies
   - Includes implementation cost and supplier information

6. **MarketplaceProduct**
   - Manages marketplace listings
   - Connects sellers with buyers for agricultural products

7. **EducationalResource**
   - Provides learning materials
   - Categorized by resource type (article, video, document, etc.)

8. **BlogPost** and related models
   - Manages the blog section
   - Includes categories, tags, and commenting system

## Authentication System

AgriTech uses Django's built-in authentication with custom extensions:

- Extended user registration with additional fields
- Custom login/logout views
- Profile management
- User type differentiation (buyer/seller)

## Multilingual Support

The platform supports multiple languages using Django's translation framework:

- Language selection stored in UserProfile
- Content available in multiple languages
- Language-specific templates where needed

## Key Features Implementation

### Marketplace

The marketplace functionality allows farmers to:
- List products for sale
- Browse available products
- Place orders
- Track order status

Implementation involves:
1. Product listing creation by sellers
2. Product browsing with filtering options
3. Order placement by buyers
4. Order management for both buyers and sellers

### Government Schemes

Government schemes are presented in an organized manner:
- Featured schemes highlighted
- Detailed information on eligibility and benefits
- Application process guidance
- Contact information

### Educational Resources

Educational resources are organized by:
- Resource type (article, video, etc.)
- Topic relevance
- Language availability

## API Endpoints

### URL Structure

The platform follows a logical URL structure:

- `/` - Homepage
- `/schemes/` - Government schemes listing
- `/schemes/<slug>/` - Scheme detail page
- `/farming-practices/` - Farming practices listing
- `/farming-practices/<slug>/` - Practice detail page
- `/technologies/` - Agricultural technologies listing
- `/technologies/<slug>/` - Technology detail page
- `/marketplace/` - Marketplace listing
- `/marketplace/<id>/` - Product detail page
- `/marketplace/create-listing/` - Create new listing
- `/educational-resources/` - Educational resources listing
- `/educational-resources/<slug>/` - Resource detail page
- `/blog/` - Blog listing
- `/blog/<slug>/` - Blog post detail page
- `/accounts/register/` - User registration
- `/accounts/login/` - User login
- `/accounts/logout/` - User logout
- `/accounts/profile/` - User profile management

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Efficient query patterns in views
- Selective field loading where appropriate

### Caching Strategy

- Template fragment caching for reusable components
- Content caching for relatively static data
- Session-based caching for user-specific data

## Security Measures

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Secure password handling
- Permission-based access control
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- XSS protection in templates

## Deployment Guidelines

### Production Setup

1. Configure production settings:
   - Set DEBUG = False
   - Configure SECRET_KEY via environment variable
   - Set up allowed hosts

2. Database migration:
   - Create production database
   - Apply migrations
   - Consider data migration strategy

3. Static files:
   - Run collectstatic
   - Configure web server for static file serving

4. Media files:
   - Configure secure media file storage and serving

5. Security:
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Configure appropriate headers
   - Consider WAF protection

### Scaling Considerations

- Database connection pooling
- Caching layer (Redis/Memcached)
- Load balancing for web servers
- Media storage offloading to CDN

## Maintenance

### Backup Strategy

- Regular database backups
- Media files backup
- Configuration backup

### Monitoring

- Application monitoring
- Error logging and tracking
- Performance metrics

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup development environment**
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure local settings

2. **Feature development**
   - Create/modify models
   - Run migrations
   - Implement views and templates
   - Write tests

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for models and views
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Manual testing

4. **Deployment**
   - Code review
   - Staging deployment
   - Production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection issues**
   - Check database credentials
   - Verify database service is running
   - Check connection pool settings

2. **Static/media files not loading**
   - Verify STATIC_URL and MEDIA_URL settings
   - Check file permissions
   - Validate web server configuration

3. **Authentication problems**
   - Check session configuration
   - Verify authentication backends
   - Inspect middleware order

4. **Performance issues**
   - Analyze database query patterns
   - Check for N+1 query problems
   - Review caching strategy
